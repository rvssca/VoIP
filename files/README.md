# Firmware upgrade - Caution!

Use extreme caution if upgrading the firmware. For no apparent reason, I bricked one phone while performing a firmware update. Three other phones had been successfully upgraded just prior.

In any case, don't upgrade the firmware unless there is a specific reason to do so. We are not using any advanced features, so if the phone is working, be happy.
